Task List Manager
This is a simple task list management project in Java that uses the MVC architecture. The program allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks from the task list through the console. In addition, unit tests have been implemented for the model and controller classes using the JUnit framework, and continuous integration has been configured using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests when committing changes to the repository.
